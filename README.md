#FAMLIY HEALTH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM




 The task is to create a "Health Management System." As everyone in family is noe=w health concious and are curious about fitness and nutrition.
 
 We will be doing this with family with five members, i.e. (dad, mom, bro, sis, Ana).
 For each Family member, we have to design their exercise and diet plan.

 To do this we need to :
 Create a food log file for each family Member
 Create an exercise log file for each family member.
 Ask the user whether they want to lock or retrieve family member data.
 Write a function that takes the user input of the family member's name.
 After the family member's name is entered, it will display a message that what you want- to plan a diet or exercise of the day

 function will be used 
 The purpose of this function will be to give time with every record of food
 or exercise added in the file.
 Write a function to retrieve exercise or food file records for any family member.
 def getdate():
     import datetime
     return datetime.datetime.now()

 
 write a function that when executed takes as input family member name
 One more function to retrieve exercise or food for any family member
